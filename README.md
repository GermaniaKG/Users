#Germania\Users

This package is distilled from legacy code. You certainly will not want to use this your production code.

##Installation

Setup MySQL database with table creation listing in  `sql/users.sql.txt`. Use Composer for PHP:

```bash
$ composer require germania-kg/users
```



##Development

Grab your clone and install PHPUnit and stuff:

```bash:
$ git clone https://github.com/GermaniaKG/Users.git germania-users
$ cd germania-users
$ composer install
```


##Testing

- Copy `phpunit.xml.dist` to `phpunit.xml` and adapt to your needs.

- In project root, run `phpunit`

- Have a look into *tests/src* directory.


##TODO

â€¢ *user_id* column name in SQL still is *client_id*. This is legacy and subject to change in upcoming major versions.
